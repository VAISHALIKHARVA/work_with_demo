Git is a version control system.

Git helps you keep track of code changes.

Git is used to collaborate on code.

Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.
*git config --global user.email "test@w3schools.com"

Git now knows that it should watch the folder you initiated it on.
Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes.
*git init 

we check the Git status and see if it is a part of our repo:
*git status

add all file in git hub
*git add .

Any time you start working on a project, you should get the most recent changes to your local copy.

With Git, you can do that with pull.

pull is a combination of 2 different commands:

fetch
merge
Let's take a closer look into how fetch, merge, and pull works.

Git fetch:
fetch gets all the change history of a tracked branch/repo.
*git fetch origin

Git Merge:
we can merge our current branch (master) with origin/master
*git merge origin/master

Git pull:
pull is a combination of fetch and merge. It is used to pull all changes from a remote repository into the branch you are working on.
*git pull origin

Push Changes to GitHub:
*git commit -a -m "Updated index.html. Resized image"
*git push origin

Pulling a Branch from GitHub:
git branch
* master

git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/html-skeleton
  remotes/origin/master
*git checkout html-skeleton

*git pull

Push a Branch to GitHub:
*git checkout -b update-readme
Switched to a new branch 'update-readme'

*git add README.md

*git commit -m "Updated readme for GitHub Branches"

*git push origin update-readme
